- **Mathematical Biology** ([MATH35032](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F022565MATH350322019-09-091V12.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - A course about the applications of mathematical methods to current questions within biology within the department of mathematics.

- **Complex Analysis** ([MATH20142](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F021727MATH201422019-07-311V13.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - A course which introduces the basic ideas of complex analysis, with particular emphasis on Cauchy's Theorem and the calculus of residues within the department of mathematics.

**Calculus and Applications A** ([MATH10222](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F009208MATH102222019-09-091V14.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - Provides an introduction to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with methods and theory associated with general first and second order ODEs. Following this, the application of differential equations is illustrated by an introduction to classical mechanics.

- **Mathematics 0F2** ([MATH19842](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F018258MATH198422019-10-301V9.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - A course in probability theory and vectors for Foundation Year students in the school of science and engineering.

- **Mathematics 1M1** ([MATH19661](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F014949MATH196612019-09-171V12.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - A course in calculus and algebra within the school of MACE.

- **Mathematics 1G1** ([MATH19731](https://my.manchester.ac.uk/uPortal/p/course-unit-info.ctf1/max/render.uP?pP_location=%2FCourseUnitPublishing%2FCourseUnitDataFiles%2FMATH%2F009213MATH197312019-07-311V8.xml&pP_action=viewCUDetails)) - A course to develop mathematical tools for symbolic and numerical manipulation and analysis within the school of materials science."
