## About

I am currently in my third year reading towards a PhD in applied mathematics at The University of Manchester. My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Oliver E. Jensen](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/oliver.jensen/) and co-supervisor is [Dr. Igor Chernyavsky](http://math-biophys.info/wiki/). I also co-organise the weekly student [Informal Applied Seminar](http://events.manchester.ac.uk/calendar/tag:ser-se-maths-appliedinformal/), where PhD students in applied mathematics discuss their research within the department. On top of this, I am the current treasurer for the [Manchester SIAM-IMA Student Chapter](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~siam/), which promotes applied mathematics and computational science to both undergraduate and postgraduate university students through a variety of events.
